# photo-gallery-using-php-oop
On this project I build a simple photo gallery using php object oriented.It also includes an admin dashboard for adding, editing ,uploading
and deleting photos.It gives the users the ability to login and comment on photos.You can use this clean code for your own projects.

### Why choose PHP OOP

OOP is faster and easier to execute. OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain,
modify and debug. OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and 
shorter development time.
